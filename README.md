#Airplane mode

Games created while:
* flying
* sitting in an economy class seat
* no Internet access
* no docs access

## Backstory
While flying I prefer to sleep, so that the hours pass quickly. If I can't sleep anymore, I prefer to code, so that the hours can pass more quickly. If can't code for work, I build trivial games.

### Game 1: Jumpy

There must be a name for this game but I can neither remember nor find it. We used to have a wooden board edition when we were kids. Selecting a dark gray square makes it orange. Then any possible position that the selected square can move to becomes green. If the selected square moves to a green square and over a dark gray square, then the latter is removed from the board. The objective is to leave as few as possible dark gray squares on the board.

### Game 2: Blackjack

We were flying with a friend. The friend was really bored. The friend played Jumpy for 2 minutes and got even more bored. I spent a few minutes building a PvP blackjack-inspired game. We spent the rest of the flight playing this game. The people around us hated us. Impossible to go bust without a noise :/
